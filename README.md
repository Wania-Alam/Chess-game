## Game Setup:

- The game is played on an 8x8 grid known as a chessboard.
- Each player starts with 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns.
- The pieces are set up in two rows on each side, with the back row (closest to the player) consisting of the more powerful pieces and the front row filled with pawns.

## Game Play:

- Players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn.
- Each type of piece has a unique way of moving across the board:
- King: One square in any direction.
- Queen: Any number of squares in any direction.
- Rook: Any number of squares vertically or horizontally.
- Bishop: Any number of squares diagonally.
- Knight: Moves in an L-shape (two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular).
- Pawn: Moves forward one square (two squares on its first move) and captures diagonally.
- Check: A move that places the opponent's king under direct threat of capture. The player must make a move to remove the check.

## Escape Routes:

- Move the king to a safe square.
- Capture the attacking piece.
- Block the attack with another piece.
- Checkmate: When the king is in check and cannot escape. This means:

The king has no legal moves to a safe square.
No other piece can capture the threatening piece.
No piece can block the attack.

## Explanation:

The black king is trapped on the back rank. The white rook on f8 puts the black king in check, and the king cannot move to h8 or f7 because both squares are controlled by white's rook, and the pawn on h7 blocks its movement to h7.
Winning the Game:

The game ends immediately when a player checkmates their opponent's king.
The player delivering the checkmate is declared the winner.

## Key Strategies for Checkmate:

Control key squares to limit the king's movement.
Coordinate multiple pieces to trap the king.
Use tactical maneuvers like pins, forks, and discovered checks to gain an advantage.
By mastering these strategies and understanding the movement of pieces, players can effectively work towards achieving checkmate and securing victory in the game of chess.
